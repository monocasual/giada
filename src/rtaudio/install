RtAudio - a set of C++ classes which provide a common API for realtime audio input/output across Linux (native ALSA, JACK, PulseAudio, and OSS), Macintosh OS X (CoreAudio and JACK), and Windows (DirectSound and ASIO) operating systems.

By Gary P. Scavone, 2001-2013.

To configure and compile (on Unix systems and MinGW):

1. Unpack the RtAudio distribution (tar -xzf rtaudio-x.x.tar.gz).
2. From within the directory containing this file, run configure:

   ./configure

3. Typing "make" will compile static and shared libraries.

4. From within the "tests" directory, type "make" to compile the example programs.

A few options can be passed to configure, including:

  --enable-debug = enable various debug output
  --with-alsa = choose native ALSA API support (linux only)
  --with-pulse = choose native PulseAudio API support (linux only)
  --with-oss = choose OSS API support (linux only)
  --with-jack = choose JACK server support (linux or Macintosh OS-X)
  --with-core = choose CoreAudio API support (Macintosh OS-X only)
  --with-asio = choose ASIO API support (windows only)
  --with-ds = choose DirectSound API support (windows only)

Typing "./configure --help" will display all the available options.  Note that you can provide more than one "--with-" flag to the configure script to enable multiple API support.

If you wish to use a different compiler than that selected by configure, specify that compiler in the command line (ex. to use CC):

  ./configure CXX=CC


WINDOWS USERS:

RtAudio compiles with the MinGW compiler or MS Visual Studio.

Visual C++ 6.0 project files (very old) are included for the test programs in the /tests/Windows/ directory.  These projects compile API support for both ASIO and DirectSound.


LINUX OSS:

The OSS API support in RtAudio has not been tested for many years.  I'm not even sure there are OSS drivers supporting recent linux kernels.  In all likelihood, the OSS API code in RtAudio will disappear within the next year or two (if you don't want this to happen, let me know).
