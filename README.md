What is Giada?
--------------
Giada is a free, minimal, hardcore audio tool for DJs, live performers
and electronic musicians. How does it work? Just pick up your channel,
fill it with samples or MIDI events and start the show by using this
tiny piece of software as a loop machine, drum machine, sequencer, live
sampler or yet as a plugin/effect host. Giada aims to be a compact and
portable virtual device for Linux, Mac OS X and Windows for production
use and live sets.
